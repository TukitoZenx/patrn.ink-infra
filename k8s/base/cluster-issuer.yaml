# ClusterIssuer for Let's Encrypt certificates
# NOTE: When using Cloudflare CDN in "Full" mode, Cloudflare handles
# public-facing TLS. This issuer generates certificates for the
# origin server (between Cloudflare and your cluster).
#
# For Cloudflare "Full (strict)" mode, you need valid origin certificates.
